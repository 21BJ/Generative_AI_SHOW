# Ai_generativa_pbc

## IDEA:
<p>
A generative AI for the creation of 3D gaming assets. <br>
Assets can be either avatars, wearables or game objects. <br>
This generative neural AI has the task of creating the assets described above starting from a textual description. <br>
The procedure will consist of three steps: <br>
<ol>
  <li>In the first step, a vast knowledge base will be consulted from which a 2D image will be generated;</li>  
  <li>In the second step the reference image will be taken for the generation of a 3D model;</li>
  <li>In the last step, parameters and metrics will be used to verify that the generated asset respects the standards of beauty. If you fail the exam the process will start again otherwise the output will be presented to the user.</li>
</ol>
</p>
